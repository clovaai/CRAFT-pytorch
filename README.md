### Sample Results

### Overview
PyTorch implementation for CRAFT text detector that effectively detect text area by exploring each character region and affinity between characters. The bounding box of texts are obtained by simply finding minimum bounding rectangles on binary map after thresholding character region and affinity scores.

## Updates
**13 Jun, 2019**: Initial update
**20 Jul, 2019**: Added post-processing for polygon result
**28 Sep, 2019**: Added the trained model on IC15 and the link refiner

* Run with pretrained model
``` (with python 3.7)
python test.py --trained_model=[weightfile] --test_folder=[folder path to test images]
```

The result image and socre maps will be saved to `./result` by default.

### Arguments
* `--trained_model`: pretrained model
* `--text_threshold`: text confidence threshold
* `--low_text`: text low-bound score
* `--link_threshold`: link confidence threshold
* `--cuda`: use cuda for inference (default:True)
* `--canvas_size`: max image size for inference
* `--mag_ratio`: image magnification ratio
* `--poly`: enable polygon type result
* `--show_time`: show processing time
* `--test_folder`: folder path to input images
* `--refine`: use link refiner for sentence-level dataset
* `--refiner_model`: pretrained refiner model
